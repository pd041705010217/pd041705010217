😀My Philosophy of Prioritizing Quality Over Quantity😀
<BR>
Focusing on quality to ensure unparalleled excellence in every aspect of your project.<BR>
I'm a full-stack developer with over a decade of experience, and my favorite programming language is ASP.NET. I find it cleaner and more reliable compared to other web frameworks like Laravel or MERN. So I still recommend using a well-structured language like this for development.<BR>

Even long distances are close when we go together.<BR>

🥇 Languages: C#, C++, JavaScript, Three.JS, HTML, CSS, SQL

🥇 Frameworks: ASP.NET, Angular, React

🥇 Tools: Vistual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Node.JS, Git, Jira, Microsoft Teams, Slack, Postgres, SQL Server Management Studio
